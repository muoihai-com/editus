    This application is a user-friendly web interface designed to work with a Ruby on Rails application. With a simple and intuitive web interface, users can conveniently access the features of the application.

    One of the key features of this application is the ability to directly edit models. This enables users to make changes directly to the data without the need to learn and use complex tools. Through the web interface, users can access and modify the attributes of models with ease.
    
    Additionally, the application provides the capability to run predefined scripts. This allows users to perform automated tasks or handle complex data processing through prebuilt scripts. Running these scripts via the web interface saves users time and effort compared to alternative methods.
